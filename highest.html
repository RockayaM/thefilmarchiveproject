        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>Highest 2 Lowest (2025) is a sharp, socially charged thriller from Spike Lee that explores power, guilt, and moral compromise. Led by a commanding Denzel Washington performance, it’s stylish and tense—though familiar at times—delivering a gripping modern update of a classic story.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>David King (Denzel Washington), a powerful music executive, sees his world unravel when a kidnapping goes wrong—the abductors take the son of his chauffeur instead of his own. Torn between protecting his empire and doing what’s right, King faces a crisis that forces him to confront his conscience and the cost of his success amid the chaos of modern New York.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>Washington anchors the film with gravitas, while Jeffrey Wright adds emotional depth as the devastated father. Spike Lee’s direction is confident, mixing slick visuals with moral tension. The film’s pacing and atmosphere keep the suspense high, and its social commentary gives it real weight.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>Some plot turns feel predictable, and a few supporting characters could have used more development. The film occasionally plays it too safe, relying on familiar beats instead of pushing its themes further.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Highest 2 Lowest doesn’t reinvent the thriller, but it delivers a smart, stylish, and thought-provoking ride. With powerhouse performances and Lee’s steady hand, it’s a gripping moral drama that lingers long after the credits roll.</p>
