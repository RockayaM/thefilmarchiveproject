        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>Good Fortune is a warm-hearted modern fable that uses fantasy and comedy to explore meaningful issues. It may not flawlessly balance its tone or themes, but with its likable cast and gentle ambition, it offers an enjoyable experience.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>The film follows Gabriel (Keanu Reeves), a well-intentioned but awkward angel whose job is to prevent texting-while-driving accidents. He intervenes in the life of Arj (Aziz Ansari), a gig-worker struggling to get by, by swapping his life with that of wealthy tech investor Jeff (Seth Rogen). As identities and fortunes shift, each character discovers what really matters—whether money, work, or connection.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>The performances lift the film—Keanu Reeves brings a charming innocence to Gabriel, Ansari is relatable as someone trying to make sense of the gig economy, and the supporting cast adds heart. The movie shines when it treats work, class and privilege with a light yet genuine touch, giving viewers something to think about while still entertaining.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>The tonal shifts sometimes feel uneven, and the individual storylines don’t always land with full impact. The themes of economic inequality and the hustle of gig work are present, but at times the film glosses over deeper complexities for the sake of comedy. The resolution may feel a bit too neat given the issues raised.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Good Fortune won’t reinvent the genre, but it succeeds as a feel-good comedy with something to say. If you’re in the mood for a light fantasy with a heart and a bit of social commentary, it’s worth a watch—especially for its earnest cast and the way it turns the “life swap” trope into a conversation about work and value.</p>
