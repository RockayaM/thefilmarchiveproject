        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>The Lost Bus (2025) is a gripping and emotional survival drama from Paul Greengrass that captures both the chaos of disaster and the quiet courage of ordinary people. Anchored by powerful performances from Matthew McConaughey and America Ferrera, the film balances pulse-pounding tension with genuine heart. While it leans on some familiar tropes, its realism and emotional sincerity make it a standout in the genre.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>Inspired by true events, the story follows Kevin McKay (McConaughey), a humble school bus driver in Paradise, California, who finds himself in the middle of the devastating 2018 Camp Fire. When flames close in faster than expected, Kevin and teacher Mary Ludwig (Ferrera) make the split-second decision to evacuate 22 children through an inferno. Their desperate journey to safety becomes a test of courage, leadership, and hope, as every mile brings new dangers—from collapsing roads to suffocating smoke.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>Greengrass brings his signature documentary-style realism, immersing the audience in the chaos with handheld camerawork and relentless pacing. McConaughey delivers one of his most grounded performances in years, portraying a man who refuses to give up even as fear consumes him. Ferrera provides warmth and quiet strength, turning moments of panic into ones of deep human connection. The film’s strongest quality is its authenticity—it’s less about spectacle and more about survival, empathy, and what people are capable of when everything is at stake.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>Some of the supporting characters, particularly among the children and townspeople, feel underdeveloped, and the film occasionally falls back on familiar disaster-movie beats. At times, the intensity of the visuals overshadows the emotional subtleties that the story hints at but doesn’t fully explore.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>The Lost Bus doesn’t reinvent the survival drama, but it elevates it with sincerity and heart. It’s a tense, beautifully made film that celebrates the resilience of ordinary heroes facing the unimaginable. Visceral, emotional, and deeply human, it’s a journey that will leave you shaken—and inspired.</p>
