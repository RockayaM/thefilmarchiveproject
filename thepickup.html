        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>The Pickup (2025) is a mismatched buddy-heist action-comedy that reunites comedy veterans with new-school energy. With Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson leading, and Keke Palmer as the witty villain, it promises fun—but ultimately stumbles under thin jokes and predictable plotting.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>Veteran armored-truck driver Russell (Murphy) is approaching retirement and looking forward to a peaceful future. His new partner Travis (Davidson) is brash, young, and eager to prove himself. During what they believe is a routine cash pickup, they’re ambushed by a criminal crew led by Zoe (Palmer), who seduces Travis to gain inside information. Chaos erupts as the heist escalates, the stakes soar far beyond the simple job, and the duo must navigate betrayal, clashing personalities, and a day spiralling wildly out of control.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>The film has a lean runtime (about 94 minutes) and does move at a solid clip, which is a plus. The cast brings charisma: Murphy’s screen presence grounds the film, and Palmer injects some spark as the tough and clever antagonist. Some of the action set-pieces have genuine energy and the occasional laugh lands thanks to the actors’ comedic instincts.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, the story is shallow and riddled with clichés. The chemistry between the leads is surprisingly underwhelming, and the writing fails to give them anything memorable to work with. Tone and pacing fluctuate: though the film aims for comedy and action, it never quite commits fully to either, and key motivations feel under-explored. Critics argue the heist logic is weak and the emotional core is missing.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>If you’re in the mood for a lightweight streaming heist flick with familiar faces and enough action to keep you entertained, The Pickup might fill the gap. But if you’re hoping for sharp comedy, fresh story beats, or strong character work, you’ll likely come away disappointed.</p>
