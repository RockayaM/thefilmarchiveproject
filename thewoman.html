        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>The Woman in Cabin 10 (2025) tries to deliver a slick psychological thriller aboard a luxury yacht, with an engrossing setup and a stellar cast. However, its execution falls short—slick visuals and strong talent struggle to overcome a plot that many find contrived and uninspired.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>Journalist Laura “Lo” Blacklock (Keira Knightley) boards a luxury super-yacht for a work assignment. One night she witnesses a woman being thrown overboard, yet the next morning all passengers are accounted for and no one believes her. As she investigates further, she risks her career—and her life.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>The concept is enticing: a closed-door mystery at sea with elite characters, isolation and paranoia. Knightley anchors the film with charisma, and the yacht setting brings a polished, glamorous visual layer to the tension. The deceptive calm of luxury contrasted with hidden danger gives the film some atmospheric strength.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>Despite the promising premise, the narrative often feels thin and predictable. The pacing drags, and many viewers found the characters’ decisions implausible. The film’s final act accelerates in a way that undercuts suspense rather than builds it.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>If you’re in the mood for a stylish, surface-level thriller and enjoy the luxury-yacht backdrop and cast, The Woman in Cabin 10 may offer light entertainment. But if you favour tight plotting, strong logic and high suspense, this adaptation may leave you disappointed.</p>
