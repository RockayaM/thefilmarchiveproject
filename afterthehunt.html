        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>After the Hunt is a thoughtful and mature drama that explores integrity, loyalty, and the gray areas of truth. Beautifully acted and visually polished, it’s a film that values conversation over spectacle. While it doesn’t always land every emotional beat, its intelligence and depth make it a compelling watch.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>The story follows Professor Alma Imhoff, a respected teacher at a prestigious university whose world is shaken when a controversy involving one of her colleagues puts her values and friendships to the test. As tensions rise on campus, Alma must decide what doing the right thing truly means, even when the answers aren’t simple.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>The film benefits from its strong cast, led by Julia Roberts, whose performance brings warmth and authenticity to Alma. The writing is thoughtful, the cinematography elegant, and the quiet tension between the characters gives the story a sense of realism. Its focus on ethical choices and personal responsibility makes it both engaging and thought-provoking.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>At times, the pacing slows and the story feels a bit heavy-handed in its message. Some supporting characters aren’t given enough time to develop, which can make certain moments feel less impactful. The ending, while reflective, may leave viewers wanting a clearer resolution.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>After the Hunt is a smart, well-crafted drama that values reflection over shock. It’s not the kind of movie that ties everything up neatly, but it invites meaningful discussion and leaves a lasting impression. A quiet, mature film that asks us to think about honesty, fairness, and the courage it takes to stand by what we believe in.</p>
