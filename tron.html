        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>Tron: Ares is a visually stunning return to the digital frontier, balancing sleek modern design with an ambitious, if uneven, story. It pushes the franchise into darker, more philosophical territory while delivering enough spectacle to satisfy longtime fans. Though its execution falters at times, it’s still a bold and memorable sci-fi experience.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>Set years after the previous films, the story follows Ares (Jared Leto), an advanced program created to cross into the real world. When ENCOM scientist Eve Kim (Greta Lee) uncovers a code that could give digital beings permanence, Ares begins questioning his purpose and the nature of existence itself. Their paths collide in a high-stakes struggle between human ambition and artificial life.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>The visuals are breathtaking, blending the signature neon aesthetic with gritty, real-world textures. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross adds emotional depth and tension, while Leto’s portrayal of Ares gives the film a quiet intensity. The movie succeeds in expanding Tron’s mythos beyond the Grid, giving the world more scale and emotional resonance.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>The narrative sometimes loses focus, with uneven pacing and underdeveloped side characters. Fans hoping for extended sequences inside the Grid may feel short-changed, as much of the story unfolds in the real world. The script occasionally leans too heavily on exposition, blunting some of its emotional impact.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Despite its flaws, Tron: Ares stands as an audacious and visually mesmerizing evolution of the franchise. It’s not as tight or emotionally gripping as it could be, but its ambition and artistry make it a worthy continuation. It’s a film that dares to question what it means to be alive—whether human or program.</p>
