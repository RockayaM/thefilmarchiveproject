        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>The Black Phone 2 is a visually ambitious sequel that leans into the nightmare-logic of ’80s horror, and at its best moments it delivers genuine chills. However, beneath the striking imagery lies a sequel that often feels overstuffed, confused in tone, and lacking the emotional clarity of its predecessor.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>Set four years after the events of the first film, the story finds Finney (now 17) still haunted by the trauma inflicted by the Grabber, while his younger sister Gwen begins receiving disturbing visions and phone-calls tied to a remote winter camp with dark ties to their mother’s past. As the siblings and a small group confront the camp-grounds’ secrets amid a blizzard, they must face not only the supernatural reach of the Grabber, but the lingering damage of their family’s history.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>The film’s greatest strength lies in its atmosphere. Director Scott Derrickson returns with his signature blend of grounded horror and supernatural unease, crafting haunting visuals and tense set pieces. The performances—especially from Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw—bring real emotional weight, and the film’s use of dreams and visions adds a layer of psychological depth.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>While the film’s ambition is admirable, its story feels overextended. The pacing dips in the middle act, and the Grabber’s return lacks some of the raw menace that made him such an effective villain before. The movie sometimes prioritizes world-building over emotional payoff, which can leave parts of the story feeling scattered.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>The Black Phone 2 may not surpass the original, but it stands as a worthy and eerie continuation. It expands the universe in intriguing ways while still delivering enough tension and heart to satisfy fans. Creepy, moody, and sometimes surprisingly touching, it’s a sequel that understands its roots—even if it occasionally stumbles trying to grow beyond them.</p>
