        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>A raw, gripping, and socially charged masterpiece, La Haine stands as one of the most powerful explorations of youth, violence, and inequality ever captured on film.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>Set over 24 tense hours in the aftermath of a violent riot in the Paris suburbs, the film follows three friends — Vinz, Saïd, and Hubert — as they navigate anger, frustration, and disillusionment in a community simmering with resentment toward the police and the system. As tensions rise, each character faces choices that will test their loyalty, morality, and control.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>Mathieu Kassovitz’s direction is sharp and purposeful, blending documentary-style realism with striking visual artistry. The black-and-white cinematography gives the film a timeless, gritty intensity, while the performances — especially from Vincent Cassel, Saïd Taghmaoui, and Hubert Koundé — feel authentic and deeply human. The dialogue crackles with energy, capturing the rhythm and rage of life on the margins.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>Some viewers may find the pacing slow or the minimalist plot lacking resolution, but these choices serve the film’s realism and emotional weight. It’s not a story of answers — it’s a mirror reflecting systemic tension and the cycle of violence.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>La Haine remains as relevant today as it was in 1995 — a haunting, fearless examination of social decay and lost youth. Its closing moments still hit with devastating force, cementing its place as a modern classic that challenges, provokes, and refuses to be forgotten.</p>
