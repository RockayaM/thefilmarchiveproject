        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>This film serves as a heartfelt finale for the Warrens’ saga—anchored by strong performances—but it doesn’t quite deliver the chilling impact that made the earlier entries in the franchise so memorable. It’s a serviceable goodbye rather than a triumphant climax.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>Years after stepping back from active investigations, Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren are drawn back when the Judy Warren (their daughter) becomes entangled in a haunting tied to an antique mirror and the troubled Smurl family. The Warrens must confront evil one last time—and pass the torch—with a case that threatens both their sense of home and the next generation.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>The returning actors (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) remain compelling and grounded, giving the film emotional weight. Judy’s character adds a fresh angle, and several sequences capture the classic haunted-house atmosphere with care and craftsmanship—especially in the film’s visual language and tone.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>The story feels overstuffed and split between too many threads, making the pacing uneven. The horror elements lack the sustained dread of earlier films and rely more heavily on obvious jump scares than lingering tension. Some of the supporting characters and subplots aren’t given enough development, which lessens the emotional stakes.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>If you’re invested in this universe and want to see the Warrens’ journey wrapped up, Last Rites delivers enough closure to satisfy. But if you hoped for the nerve-shredding suspense of the series at its peak, you might feel it falls a bit short. It’s a respectful farewell—slight in impact, strong in heart.</p>
