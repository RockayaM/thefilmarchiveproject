        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>Nonnas (2025) is a heartwarming comedy-drama that serves up comfort and nostalgia in equal measure. Directed with affection and sprinkled with humour, it celebrates food, family, and the wisdom of age. While it leans heavily on familiar tropes and predictability, its sincerity and warmth make it a satisfying watch for anyone craving a feel-good story.</p>
        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>After losing his mother, Joe (Vince Vaughn) finds himself adrift and searching for purpose. To honour her memory, he opens an Italian restaurant unlike any other—staffed entirely by real nonnas, each bringing her own regional dishes and personality to the kitchen. As Joe bonds with the grandmothers, he learns about love, resilience, and what it truly means to find family again. Meanwhile, tensions rise as business pressures and personal grief collide in the heart of the bustling restaurant.</p>
        <h2>What Works</h2>
        <p>The film’s biggest strength lies in its cast. The nonnas themselves are the soul of the story—funny, outspoken, and brimming with authenticity. Their chemistry with Vaughn gives the film its emotional core, and the cooking scenes are gorgeously shot, turning every meal into a love letter to tradition. The humor feels natural, the lessons heartfelt, and the overall tone comforting without becoming overly sentimental.</p>
        <h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
        <p>The plot follows a familiar recipe, and the conflicts are often resolved a little too neatly. Some supporting characters, including Joe’s family and love interest, feel underdeveloped. While the film delivers charm and heart, it occasionally shies away from deeper emotional risks, sticking to the safe and predictable rather than exploring the more complex layers of grief and renewal.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Nonnas (2025) may not reinvent the genre, but it doesn’t need to. It’s a tender, flavorful film that celebrates heritage, healing, and the power of shared meals. For those who love heartwarming stories with great food, lovable characters, and a dash of humour, Nonnas is a cinematic comfort dish worth savoring.</p>
